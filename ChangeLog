nilfs2-kmod10-2.2  Mon Nov 4, 2024 JST

	* backport fixes for two kernel bug that could occur when file system
	  corruption was detected and the mount mode was degraded to read-only:
	  - nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flag
	  - nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag

	* backport a fix for a potential deadlock issue:
	  - nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks

nilfs2-kmod10-2.1  Fri Oct 18, 2024 JST

	* backport an upstream fix for a problem where a directory search could
	  loop for a long time on a broken filesystem, which could result in a
	  large amount of error logs being output in bursts:
	  - nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()

	* backport one page->folio conversion patch for mount time recovery
	  implementation:
	  - nilfs2: Use a folio in nilfs_recover_dsync_blocks()

nilfs2-kmod10-2.0  Sun Sep 22, 2024 JST

	* backport upstream changes to add support for common ioctls for
	  getting the volume UUID and the relative path of an FS instace within
	  the sysfs namespace, and for getting and setting the volume label:
	  - nilfs2: add support for FS_IOC_GETFSUUID
	  - nilfs2: add support for FS_IOC_GETFSSYSFSPATH
	  - nilfs2: add support for FS_IOC_GETFSLABEL
	  - nilfs2: add support for FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL

	* backport upstream fixes that prevent internal code -ENOENT from
	  propagating to system calls:
	  - nilfs2: treat missing sufile header block as metadata corruption
	  - nilfs2: treat missing cpfile header block as metadata corruption
	  - nilfs2: do not propagate ENOENT error from sufile during recovery
	  - nilfs2: do not propagate ENOENT error from sufile during GC
	  - nilfs2: do not propagate ENOENT error from
	    nilfs_sufile_mark_dirty()

	* backport upstream fixes for three potential issues with empty b-tree
	  nodes that can occur with corrupted file system images, including one
	  recently discovered by syzbot:
	  - nilfs2: fix potential null-ptr-deref in nilfs_btree_insert()
	  - nilfs2: determine empty node blocks as corrupted
	  - nilfs2: fix potential oob read in nilfs_btree_check_delete()

	* backport a change to suppress nuisance kernel warnings that are
	  output after detecting file system corruption and degrading to a
	  read-only mount:
	  - nilfs2: do not output warnings when clearing dirty buffers

	* backport upstream fixes that correct a number of formatting issues in
	  kernel doc comments and suppress warnings output by kernel-doc
	  scripts:
	  - nilfs2: add missing argument description for __nilfs_error()
	  - nilfs2: add missing argument descriptions for ioctl-related helpers
	  - nilfs2: improve kernel-doc comments for b-tree node helpers
	  - nilfs2: fix incorrect kernel-doc declaration of nilfs_palloc_req
	    structure
	  - nilfs2: add missing description of nilfs_btree_path structure
	  - nilfs2: describe the members of nilfs_bmap_operations structure
	  - nilfs2: fix inconsistencies in kernel-doc comments in segment.h
	  - nilfs2: fix missing initial short descriptions of kernel-doc
	    comments

	* backport assorted cleanups:
	  - nilfs2: use common implementation of file type
	  - nilfs2: use the BITS_PER_LONG macro
	  - nilfs2: separate inode type information from i_state field
	  - nilfs2: eliminate the shared counter and spinlock for i_generation
	  - nilfs2: do not repair reserved inode bitmap in nilfs_new_inode()
	  - nilfs2: remove sc_timer_task
	  - nilfs2: use kthread_create and kthread_stop for the log writer
	    thread
	  - nilfs2: refactor nilfs_segctor_thread()
	  - nilfs2: remove duplicate 'unlikely()' usage

nilfs2-kmod10-1.1  Thu Sep 5, 2024 JST

	* backport upstream bug fixes for issues such as memory access
	  violations or invalid pointer dereferencing due to missing exclusive
	  controls in the sysfs interface, a use-after-free bug in an error
	  path of recovery during mount, and hangs and metadata block loss
	  due to insufficient cleanup after log writer errors:
	  - nilfs2: fix state management in error path of log writing function
	  - nilfs2: fix missing cleanup on rollforward recovery error
	  - nilfs2: protect references to superblock parameters exposed in
	    sysfs

	* add kern_feature.h header file
	* add makefiles
	* add COPYING file
	* add README file
	* add .gitignore file
