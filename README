* Required packages

- gcc
- make
- binutils
- kernel-devel

You also need to install nilfs-utils package.  The garbage collector
of NILFS, snapshot management tools, man-pages, and other filesystem
administration tools, are included in the package.

* Caveat

This kernel module release is experimental and is not guranteed to be
released continuously in the future.  Although nilfs2 file system is
included in the mainline kernel, the distro kernels that this module
targets backport patches independently, so it may be difficult to keep
up in the future and it may not be possible to release a compatible
kernel module.
